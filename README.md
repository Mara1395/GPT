# GPT-3

## 📄 Introduction

In order to further improve myself in React, I follow Adrian Hajdin's YouTube tutorials. Some of my repositories will be projects that I created according to the tutorial.

### Through this project I learned:
* React Functional components and their reusability
* React file and folder structure
* Fundamental CSS properties to master flex & grid
* Fundamentals of the CSS BEM Model
* From soft and pleasant animations to complex gradients
* Perfectly placed media queries for satisfactory responsiveness covering almost devices
* And at the end you'll learn how to deploy your websites to extremely fast servers and give them a custom domain name.


## 🛠 Languages & Tools
* React JS for building the UI
* Tailwind CSS for styling components
