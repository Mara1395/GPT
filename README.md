# GPT-3

## 📄 Introduction

In order to further improve myself in React, I follow Adrian Hajdin's YouTube tutorials. Some of my repositories will be projects that I created according to the tutorial.

### Through this project I learned:
* React Functional components and their reusability
* React file and folder structure
* Fundamental CSS properties to master flex & grid
* Fundamentals of the CSS BEM Model
* From soft and pleasant animations to complex gradients
* Perfectly placed media queries for satisfactory responsiveness covering almost devices
* And at the end you'll learn how to deploy your websites to extremely fast servers and give them a custom domain name.



In the project directory, you can run:

npm start
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

npm test
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.

npm run build
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!
