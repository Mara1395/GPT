* Fundamental CSS properties to master flex & grid
* Fundamentals of the CSS BEM Model
* From soft and pleasant animations to complex gradients
* Perfectly placed media queries for satisfactory responsiveness covering almost devices
* And at the end you'll learn how to deploy your websites to extremely fast servers and give them a custom domain name.
