# GPT-3

## 📄 Introduction

In order to further improve myself in React, I follow Adrian Hajdin's YouTube tutorials. Some of my repositories will be projects that I created according to the tutorial.

### Through this project I learned:
* React Functional components and their reusability
* React file and folder structure
* Fundamental CSS properties to master flex & grid
* Fundamentals of the CSS BEM Model
* From soft and pleasant animations to complex gradients
* Perfectly placed media queries for satisfactory responsiveness covering almost devices
* And at the end you'll learn how to deploy your websites to extremely fast servers and give them a custom domain name.


## Options
In the project directory, you can run:

⚙️ __npm start__ 
<br>
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The page will reload when you make changes.


⚙️ __npm test__
<br>
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. See the section about running tests for more information.

⚙️ __npm run build__
<br>
Builds the app for production to the build folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
